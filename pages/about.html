                <h1>About Clear Brook Orchestra</h1> 
                <p class="abt text">The Clear Brook Orchestra program aims to create an optimal environment for the development of musical skill and the nurturing of artistic passion. Under Brady Meyer’s direction, students with instrumental experience are given the opportunity to expand their musical borders both as an individual and as a member of an orchestra. Together, you will learn pieces that challenge your own skillset and hone the perspective of being one part of a larger whole. Within the program, those wishing for personal aid have easy access to an array of seasoned musicians for private tutoring. Challenging annual events including UIL Solo and Ensemble, and TMEA Region and All-State are heavily encouraged and supported. Seasonal concerts alongside a multitude of social events provide a busy schedule full of not only musical growth but the development of friendships and comradery within a unique community.</p>
