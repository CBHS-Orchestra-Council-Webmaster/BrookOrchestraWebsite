                <h1>About Clear Brook Orchestra</h1> 
                <p class="abt text">The Clear Brook Orchestra program aims to create an optimal environment for the development of musical skill and the nurturing of artistic passion. Under Brady Meyer’s direction, students with instrumental experience are given the opportunity to expand their musical borders both as an individual and as a member of an orchestra. Together, you will learn pieces that challenge your own skillset and hone the perspective of being one part of a larger whole. Within the program, those wishing for personal aid have easy access to an array of seasoned musicians for private tutoring. Challenging annual events including UIL Solo and Ensemble, and TMEA All-Region and All-State are heavily encouraged and supported. Seasonal concerts alongside a multitude of social events provide a busy schedule full of not only musical growth but the development of friendships and comradery within a unique community.</p>

During his time at Clear Brook, the orchestra program has grown considerably and consistently earned sweepstakes awards at UIL.  Mr. Meyer began his musical studies at an early age, studying piano with Dr. Sooah Chae and cello with Ms. Charlotte Eads and Dr. Cornelia Watkins. After graduating from Deer Park High School, he went on to study cello performance at Texas Tech University with Mr. Jeffrey Lastrapes. During that time, Mr. Meyer was a member of the Lubbock Symphony Orchestra and performed cello concertos by Haydn, Strauss, and Shostakovich with orchestras in Maine and Lubbock. In addition, Mr. Meyer served as rehearsal pianist and harpsichordist for Texas Tech’s production of Mozart’s Cosi Fan Tutti, which toured to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Mr. Meyer obtained his Master of Music in conducting at Bowling Green State University with Dr. Emily Freeman Brown. While attending BGSU, he directed student composed chamber operas, worked with musicians from the Berlin Philharmonic, Pittsburgh Symphony, and Toledo Symphony, cover conducted opera productions of Die Fledermaus and Dialogues of the Carmelites, and performed over 50 world premieres by student, faculty, and guest composers. He has also spent four summers performing and conducting at the prestigious Pierre Monteux School for Conductors under the mentorship of Michael Jinbo. During the summer of 2016 he was invited to conduct at the International Conductor’s Workshop and Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria, led by Larry Rachleff and Donald Schleicher, then later conducted at the John Hopkins Peabody Institute’s Conducting Workshop with Markand Thakar. Currently, Mr. Meyer lives in Friendswood, TX and is an active cellist, pianist, conductor, and clinician in the greater Houston area.
